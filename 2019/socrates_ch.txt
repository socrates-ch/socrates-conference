Is there a magic google sheet for the participants as there was one last year?

Which train are you going to take from Zurich?
I will be joinig the ride in Landquart.

Jeroen [09:26 Uhr]
Are there people taking the train from Zurich near 17:00 (on the 28th)? I am thinking of taking a plane that arrived at the airport at 15:45 and would prefer to tag along with someone that knows the route or at least knows German/Switzerland better than I do.

Jeroen [10:35 Uhr]
I will bring these games

For those going by train, please be advised that the last section of the line is closed :( 
Their is a replacement bus,.
People going directly to Ftan, could go vi Ardez

Rhätische Bahn
Total closure of the Lower Engadin line
Due to the need to completely renovate both the Giarsun Tunnel and the Magnacun Tunnel on Rhaetian Railway’s Lower Engadin line, the track must be closed for six months. From 11 March to 7 September 2019, therefore, the section between Susch and Scuol-Tarasp will be closed to rail traffic. During the six-month closure of the line, a rail replacement bus service will be in operation in the Lower Engadin. Direct connections currently running between Landquart and St. Moritz and the Vereina car transporter are not affected.

Jeroen [10:05 Uhr]
Is there any coordination going on to travel from Zurich to Ftan yet? The closed line stuff above makes me extra scared of that bit of travel :leichtes_lächeln:

Oliver Nautsch [13:08 Uhr]
I have space for 4 additional people in my car. Zurich -> Ftan

Jeroen [14:08 Uhr]
I'd love a spot. When are you making that trip?

patbaumgartner [06:40 Uhr]
Btw. I will send out on the weekend some information about travelling and basic packing.

patbaumgartner [06:41 Uhr]
Leaving Zurich around Lunchtime is always a good idea: In previous years, most took the train at 13:37 and arrived around 17:00 at the venue.

patbaumgartner [08:22 Uhr]
Just as an information: I sent out this morning more information and a packing list. Make sure you read it :zwinkern:

Jeroen [11:35 Uhr]
What is the "fondue place on a mountain"? Does it have a website?

Jeroen [11:38 Uhr]
The packing list has "outdoor shoes with a grip". Does something like these (normal hiking boots) work?

I'd like to do a session on the Clean Architecture tomorrow. Since there is no chance I make the marketplace, *I'm looking for someone to present this session* for me and put the already created paper thing on the board.

when: second session track after lunch
where: hackergarten (beamer needed)
what: an introduction to the Clean Architecture plus story of how we implemented it at Wikimedia Deutschland. Can be interactive and maybe turn into code review if the audience so desires (bearbeitet)

What we talked about in team structure
Wikipedia
Situational leadership theory
Situational Leadership Theory, or the Situational Leadership Model, is a model created by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard, developed while working on Management of Organizational Behavior. The theory was first introduced in 1969 as "life cycle theory of leadership". During the mid-1970s, life cycle theory of leadership was renamed "Situational Leadership Theory."Situational Leadership emerged as one of a related group of two-factor theories of leadership, many of which originated in research done at Ohio State University in the 1960s. These two-factor theories hold that possibilities in leadership style are composed of combinations of two main variables: task behavior and relationship behavior… Mehr anzeigen

Wikipedia
Big Five personality traits
The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a taxonomy for personality traits. It is based on common language descriptors. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe… Mehr anzeigen

Guys, thanks for the awesome weekend. Can you guys post your awesome pictures?

Hi! Just a friendly nudge that "guys" is a bit gender-specific, and we'd prefer something more neutral, such as "Folks" or "Everyone" or "All." Thanks!

List of system quality attributes
Within systems engineering, quality attributes are realized non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system.  These are sometimes named "ilities" after the suffix many of the words share. They are usually Architecturally Significant Requirements that require architects' attention.

Arlo Belshee - Refactoring to asynchronous pattern
How do we change causality without breaking things? There are a lot of problems we solve with accidentally synchronous solutions: functions and procedures that do the work when called. These are great for simplicity and debuggability. However, they can present problems with testability and responsiveness. But changing this choice is hard. Execution model is effectively an architectural concern. In this talk we will refactor between synchronous and asynchronous approaches to common problems: UI, data processing, and assembling components into bigger components. We will do this with true refactoring: incremental, able to stop at any time, and proving that no step ever introduces our fixes a bu… Mehr anzeigen
